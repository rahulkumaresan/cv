              <h1 style="color: white;">100 Million And More Indian Jobs Are At Risk After COVID-19 Lockdown. Is Your Job Safe?</h1>

              <center><img src="ln1.jpg" height="400px" width="700px">
              <p>
                Take a deep breath before you read this, and know that these are only scenarios—thumbnail sketches of what may happen. We cannot yet pluck the future out of the crystal ball, and the future may yet hold surprises. But yes, in one of the better worst-case scenarios out there, 100 million and more Indian jobs will be at risk during and after the COVID-19 lockdown stage. CII, a leading industry association, asked industry bosses how they felt things would pan out—of the 200 CEOs surveyed, one-third expected job losses of  15-30 per cent in their respective sectors. Another 47 per cent felt the figures might be slightly less than 15 per cent. But translated into actual numbers, the scenario still seems scary. Tot up the estimates of those likely to be unemployed in the various sectors, and it’s a horror movie coming to a screen—sorry, office—near you.
                From end-March, most companies have resorted to one of these three decisions—sacking people, asking employees to go on indefinite leave without pay, and slashing salaries by as much as 85 per cent. Emotional and distressing emails about jobs and wage cuts were dispatched from their corner rooms by CEOs to employees, some of whom had worked in the same companies for decades. The Dubai-based CEO of Triburg, an apparel-sourcing firm, wrote, “In my 48 years of working life, I have never seen such a difficult situation....”
                Those mercilessly pink-slipped are often too scared to even tell their families. “I don’t have the courage,” reveals Rohit Verma (name changed), who worked in the marketing division of Makino India, an auto-ancillary firm, and whose family includes his wife (homemaker), old parents and two children. Those who are at home are unsure if they will ever go back to their offices. “My owner gave Rs 7,000 in March, when the lockdown was announced. He assured us of future salaries, but I am not sure. I am not even sure about my job,” says Deepak Kumar, who operates a cloth-weaving machine at a garment firm.
               <br>
               Fortunately, there is also an optimistic scenario—indeed, that will most likely intersect with the more depressing tendencies to produce a complex reality. The usual picture of a shell-shocked economy with zero demand may be too simplistic. Yes, the pain of unemployment will be felt acutely over the next three to six months, but there can also be a quick rebound. In fact, the creation of fresh jobs and a return of old ones may happen sooner than we expect due to two reasons. The first is psychological: consumers, liberated after being cooped up at home for over five weeks, may go berserk once the lockdown is lifted. They may wish to buy more, spend more—certainly, travel more. It may be irrational, but very human to go overboard. Of course, this release of pent-up demand will be restricted to those who retain their jobs.

However, the first challenge is to get suitable for this demanded job since technology is constantly evolving. So, the first question should be: how to obtain all the required skills?

                Of course, you can never go wrong with a relevant college degree when just getting started in the field. But if you are a seasoned professional who needs some upgrade the task becomes more difficult.

                Exam 70-744 emphasizes the skills required to secure Windows Server 2016 enterprise environments. All exam candidatesought to be familiarwith most of the tools and methods commonly used to protect the Windows Server platform. 
                
                The Certbolt Microsoft 70-744 assessment covers 6 major objectives that are usually validated by the MCSE certification in Core Infrastructure. The skills tested include how the applicant can implement Server Hardening Solutions, Threat Detection Solutions and the security of a Workload-Specific type. The candidate should also know how to provide security of the Network Infrastructure and Virtualization Infrastructure as well as efficiently manage Privileged Identities.</p>
              <p>The first place you may visit when starting preparation is the Microsoft website where you’ll find several vendor-offered training materials. One of the outstanding options here is instructor-led learning that features 20744A training course.

              <h1 style="color: white;">Facebook may add new job features to help people who get fired during coronavirus crisis</h1>
              <center><img src="ln3.jpg" height="400px" width="700px">
              
              <p>Facebook is reportedly working on a new set of features to help those who have lost their jobs due to the coronavirus pandemic. Jane Manchun Wong, who is known as a reverse software engineer, found two hidden features that Facebook is working on to help unemployed people. She found a feature called COVID-19 Employment Resource along with another feature called Job</p>
              <p>The COVID-19 Employment Resource seems to help users in the US which provides a link to the Department of Labor's website through which users can go through unemployment benefits and other details. It would be interesting how Facebook customises this feature for different countries if at all it plans to roll it globally.</p>
            <p>The Job Application Questions functionality asks about specific questions related to someone’s job like certifications, training, availability date, etc. Wong claims that Facebook may be rolling out both the features very soon, however, it remains to be seen whether these will be released in India or not.
            </p>  
            <p>Meanwhile, Facebook has expanded its Covid-19 community help hub features and has added a new feature that will allow users to help local businesses, blood banks and non-profit organisations in the US.
              As part of the new features, the app is going to enable its users to buy gift cards to local businesses. Facebook users will also be able to sign up to donate to local nonprofits and fundraisers. Lastly, they will also get to sign up to be a donor at local blood banks and find local job opportunities.
              Facebook has also launched a fundraiser’s platform to help accelerate efforts against COVID-19. The platform will allow users to start a fundraiser on Facebook for the cause and charity that matters most to them.</p>

              <h1 style="color: white;">Why upskilling will be important in post COVID-19 job scene</h1>
              <center><img src="ln4.jpg" height="400px" width="700px">
              
              <p>COVID-19 has made life tough on both sides of the money divide--while businessmen are worried over not just demand and supply but vagaries of production and availability of labour, salaried professionals across-the-board are staring at salary cuts, delayed payments and bans on bonuses and increments. Or worse, job losses. 
                According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), one in four employees in India lost their jobs in just the last two months, as the coronavirus induced scare led to a nationwide cessation of economic activity. That’s a whopping 12.2 crore people we are talking about!
                
                
                 
                And the worse may be yet to come—a snap poll was done among the CEOs by the industry chamber CII earlier this week showed that almost half of them believed they may have to fire up to 30 per cent of their staff.</p>
              <p>“In the long term, there could be staff (cuts) in the blue-collar and grey-collar, and reduced demand in the entry-level segment, as discretionary spending gets muted,” feels Nilabh Kapoor, Head of Revenue, OLX People (Horizontal Business Unit). Adds Payal Kumar, professor and chair (HR/OB) at BML Munjal University, “Certain industries may have been hit so badly that recovery may be very difficult, for example, hospitality and airlines. Many start-ups, too, may not survive.”

                Two uncertainties could make the job market bleaker for both the salaried as well as new job aspirants. One is if the COVID-19 graph keeps rising, not just in India but across the world. India already has the unenviable task of restarting business even while grappling with a disastrous bureaucratic approach to lockdown which has seen migrant workforce flee to their villages, or even worse, struck in cities waiting for the first chance to go back home. </p>

However, customer service, marketing and sales are some of the sectors that are badly impacted by the job cuts so far, reveal HR experts.

                Meanwhile, deamnd of work-from-home (WFH) jobs that pay around Rs 5 lakh annually have doubled as compared with February, said Naukri.
                
                Forhire’s Step-Up initiative, launched around two weeks ago, keep a track of companies and industries that are currently recruiting along with active jobs to apply for, in addition to launching personalised hiring drives.
